You can try my project at [Foodbook](https://foodbook.onrender.com/).

This site is basically for people to see the dishes of the restaurant before they order it

This is my Flow Chart of the project

![foodbook-user-flow-Google-Drawings](./frontend/src/assets/foodbook-user-flow-Google-Drawings.png)

My motivation for this site came from the fact that when I'm in a restaurant I always try to look for pictures of the dishes before I order, and I don't always find

The main technologies of the site are `Nodejs` `React` `Express` and using with `MongoDB`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`
